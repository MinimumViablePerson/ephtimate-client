# Ephtimate Client

Welcome to the web client for the Ephtimate app, made with [React][1] and [Redux][2].

## What is Ephtimate?

Ephtimate is a small web application that will hopefully make your task estimation a little easier by allowing any member to give their estimation using any kind of device, be it a mobile, a laptop, or a tablet.

## How to run it locally

You will need to have Node.js installed. If you don't already, find out how [here][3].

Once that is done, [clone this repository][4], head to its folder and run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.

Last but not least, to be able to use the client locally, you will also need to be running your own [**Ephtimate server**][5] locally.
